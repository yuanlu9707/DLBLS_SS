# DLBLS_SS
The code is implemented using MATLAB 2020a and MATLAB 2022a.

The CASP dataset can be downloaded from the website https://predictioncenter.org/.

The code mainly provides model code and parameters, and the data processing part has been deleted. 
In addition, the attached SETCN_example file can be used as a reference.

The MultiplicationLayer file needs to be replaced.
The MultiplicationLayer file is located at: D:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2022a\toolbox\nnet\cnn\+nnet\+cnn\+layer
